# Color-Transform-Engine-CTE-

Preface : 
The main goal is to Design a transform circuit between YUV and RGB. I believe everyone is familiar with RGB so I am not going to introduce it. YUV is the color model which is easy to be found in image process unit. In the YUV color model, Y stands for Luminance (brightness) component, while U and V represent the Chrominance (color) components. The main difficulty of this problem lies in handling negative numbers and decimals (including rounding)
